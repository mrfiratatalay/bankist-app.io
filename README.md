# 🏦 The Bankist App — A Realistic Banking UI Project

Welcome to the **Bankist App**, a collaborative JavaScript project simulating an online banking interface with dynamic user interactions and real data manipulation using built-in array methods.

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

Developed by **Fırat Atalay** and **Ayşe Mandıralı**, this project was an opportunity for us to deepen our JavaScript skills while exploring how data-driven interfaces function in a real-world banking context.

We worked together to implement key features like user login, transactions, data formatting, and logout timers — while learning the importance of logic, UI clarity, and state management.

## 💼 Project Description

**Bankist** is a minimalistic banking app that includes the following features:

- User login authentication
- Transfer of funds between users
- Requesting and granting loans
- Account closing functionality
- Transaction history display (with dates and currency formatting)
- Auto logout timer after inactivity
- Smooth scroll navigation

The focus was to use advanced **JavaScript array methods** such as:

- `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `find()`, `some()`, `every()`, `sort()`, `flat()`, and `flatMap()`  
To process, display, and manage financial transaction data dynamically.

## 🧠 What We Learned

- When and how to use JavaScript’s array methods effectively  
- Structuring user-centered applications  
- Enhancing the UI with responsive DOM interactions  
- Managing time-based events with timers  
- Practicing clean, modular, and maintainable JavaScript

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This project taught us that great software isn’t just about writing code — it’s about solving problems, creating intuitive experiences, and handling data responsibly.

We built this together to better understand the logic behind real applications.
